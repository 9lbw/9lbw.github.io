      About Me
     </h2>
     <p>
      I'm Phillip. Online, I go by 9lbw, an alias derived from a pretentious Japanese visual novel about mages and historical figures. I figured the name truly radiates "professional at work."
      <p>
       My first foray into this world was as "thatrtxdude," a username that was both unfortunate and inaccurate after I switched to AMD. I became a Source Engine modder for games like Garry's Mod and Left 4 Dead 2, a career that met a spectacular end when my primary dependency imploded. Its creator had a meltdown of biblical proportions, rage-quit the internet, and vaporized his addons, turning my Steam Workshop into a mass grave overnight.
      </p>
      <p>
       It turns out that tying your legacy to a man who writes fanfiction about his own overpowered OCs is a poor long-term strategy. It was, however, a fantastic lesson in dependency stability and choosing your dependencies wisely. After that humbling experience, my interests shifted toward building my own tools from scratch, turning a hobby fueled by community chaos into a passion for real engineering.
